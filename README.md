# Phishing Email Detection using NLP and BERT

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting phishing emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a pre-trained BERT model. With the rising threat of phishing attacks, it is essential to build robust solutions capable of identifying and flagging malicious emails before they harm users. 

This model processes and classifies email text to determine whether an email is a phishing attempt or legitimate. It leverages advanced language models like BERT for text analysis, providing high accuracy and reliability.

## Features
- **Email Classification**: The model analyzes email content to classify it as phishing or legitimate.
- **Pre-trained BERT Model**: We use the pre-trained `BERT-base uncased` model for text classification, which can be further fine-tuned for optimal results.
- **Dataset Handling**: The project uses datasets containing both legitimate and phishing emails for training and evaluation.
- **Text Preprocessing**: The project includes text cleaning, tokenization, and padding to prepare email content for model training.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Key performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the model.

## Dataset
The model is trained and tested using publicly available datasets:
- **Phishing Emails Dataset** (Kaggle): Contains a variety of phishing emails for model training.
- **Enron Email Dataset** (Kaggle): A set of legitimate emails used to balance the dataset.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Framework for building and training the deep learning model.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Library used to load and fine-tune BERT.
- **NLTK/spaCy**: For email text preprocessing and cleaning.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: Data manipulation and analysis tools.
- **Sklearn**: For evaluating model performance.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-email-detector.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and tokenize the emails.
3. Train the model using the training script provided in the `scripts/` directory.
4. Evaluate the model on the test dataset and view the results.

## Future Improvements
- Add real-time email detection.
- Integrate additional features such as metadata extraction (e.g., email headers, IP addresses).
- Explore other NLP models like GPT or RoBERTa for better performance.
